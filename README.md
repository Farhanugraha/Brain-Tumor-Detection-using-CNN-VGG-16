# Brain-Tumor-Detection-using-CNN-VGG-16
Brain Tumor Detection with 99% training accuracy 
🧠 Brain Tumor Classification using CNN (VGG-16)
This project focuses on classifying brain tumor images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on the VGG-16 architecture. The model was trained on a labeled brain MRI dataset and achieved 99% training accuracy and 9% validation accuracy (indicative of overfitting, subject to further model improvement and tuning).

🔧 Key Features:
Implemented using TensorFlow and Keras

Preprocessing and augmentation techniques applied to improve dataset quality

Transfer learning using pre-trained VGG-16 model

Final model tested and deployed using Streamlit for interactive web-based inference

Users can upload brain MRI images to get real-time classification results

📊 Technologies:
Python, TensorFlow, Keras

OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib

Streamlit (for UI testing)

🚀 Future Improvements:
Improve generalization to reduce validation error

Apply regularization techniques or collect more balanced data

Optimize Streamlit interface for broader usability
